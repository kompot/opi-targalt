## Disclaimer. Not even a working prototype yet. Do not use at least until this disclaimer is gone.

Learning a rare language that does not have enough audio content of your basic level?

Make use of modern text to speech technologies that are able to generate hiqh quality speech from subtitles.

Use this project to generate a dubbed video file in any language available at [Play.ht](https://play.ht/) with a half muted English audio track and your language of choice dubbed over it.

All you need is original video file and an .SRT subtitles file.

## What a weird name?!

`Õpi targalt` means `learn the smart way` in Estonian.
